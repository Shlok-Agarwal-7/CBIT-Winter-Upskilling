Build a Non Linear Regression model and get 90% Accuracy for the above simulated data in
question2. Split the data into 70% and 30% respectively for Training and Testing for model
building

Build any five Classifiers for the above dataset in question1 and compare the metrics of these built
models. Metrics need to build are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1Score. Split the data into 70%
and 30% respectively for Training and Testing for model building

Load CSV, EXCEL, EXCELS, JSON format datasets from local host and Websites into Colab
interface and split them into Train and test data.

Load different datasets from SkLearn library into Colab interface and split them into train and
test data. Apply Normalization techniques to convert input data into standardize.

Load any data from website/Local host and apply the below data wrangling techniques
a. Split b) merge c) select rows by conditions d) select columns by conditions e) Rename
columns f) Min, max, avg, varience g) describe h) size I) shape j) find unique values k)
find missing values and fill them with average value/ mode value l) replace attribute
value name with other name m)delete columns n) delete some rows o) join datasets(left,
right) p) groups values by rows q) loop over columns r) group rows by time s)
concatenating datasets t) append rows u)append columns w) reorder columns using
pandas lib
